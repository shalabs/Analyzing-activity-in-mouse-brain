# Analyzing activity in mouse brain

## Overview of data

The data are a time-series of fluorescence images measured of at OHSU Lab of Charles Allen 
(https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/oregon-institute-occupational-health-sciences/research/allen/).

They use a fluorescent protein as a reporter for the circadian clock gene Period1. They are able to follow the expression of this gene in many neurons for several days to understand how the neural network in the suprachiasmatic nucleus synchronizes the circadian clock of individual neurons to produce a precise circadian rhythm. They analyze each image to determine the fluorescence intensity of each neuron over multiple circadian cycles.
